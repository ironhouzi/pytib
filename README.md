Software for Tibetan word processing

Dependencies:
+ Python 3.3

Currently only handles wylie to Tibetan Unicode conversion.

It is also worth mentioning that the current version takes single letter vowel wylie strings ('o', 'i', 'u', 'e') and prepends an 'a' to these, turning them into: ('ao', 'ai', 'au', 'ae').
