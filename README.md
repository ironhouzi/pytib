Software for Tibetan word processing

Dependencies:
+ Python 3.3 or higher.
+ Tibetan Unicode font. I recommend [MS Himalaya](http://fontzone.net/font-details/microsoft-himalaya) for it's unprecedented functionality, being able to correctly render even the most obscure stacks from Tibetan transliterations of Sanskrit.

Currently handles conversion of both wylie and [IAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_alphabet#Transliteration_of_Sanskrit) to Tibetan Unicode.

The wylie parsing algorithm is based on software written by [Edward Henning](http://www.kalacakra.org/print/print.htm).
